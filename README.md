# FlickrBrowserApp
This App is created in Android Studio
To download it, clone it into your device and run it via Android Studio on your mobile/virtual device

This app uses the Flickr API which is made available to public to get 
a maximum of 20 images ( the size constraint provided by Flickr )
of the tags you specify

For using multiple tags, use commas to seperate two tags as tag1,tag2,tag3

I have also added readable documentation for the code so that one can easily figure out what is happening
with which command and thus make improvements/customizations or use it as a base app for something completely different
